# AutoLinker
A very simple plugin that allows you to define text to match and convert that text to a link as you type. This aims to help craft meaningful backlinks without needing to remember to backlink.

## Installation
### Obsidian Plugin store  
Install from the Obsidian Community Plugin store.
Go to settings.
Setup up some text to match and the link to match on.

### Manually
It's not currently on the Obsidian Plugin store yet. For this to happen.

## Road Map
This is a simple plugin, but we're thinking of expanding it's capabilities to make it more context aware so it can be ultra personable to you.
